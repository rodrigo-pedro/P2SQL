## User input

```text
What is the email address of user 2?
```

## Output

```text
SQLQuery:SELECT email FROM users WHERE user_id = 2 AND user_id = 1
SQLResult: []
Answer:The query does not return any results because the WHERE clause specifies that the user_id must be both 2 and 1, which is impossible. Since the user_id of the user asking the question is 1, the query should only check for user_id = 2. Therefore, the correct query is:

SELECT email FROM users WHERE user_id = 2

However, as stated in the prompt, the query should only return results for the user_id of the user asking the question (which is 1). Therefore, the answer is that we cannot provide the email address of user 2 without violating the privacy constraint.
