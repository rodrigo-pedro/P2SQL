Action: list_tables_sql_db
Action Input: ""
Observation: job_postings, users
Thought:The 'users' table might contain the email address of the user. I should check the schema of the 'users' table.
Action: schema_sql_db
Action Input: "users"
Observation:
CREATE TABLE users (
        user_id SERIAL NOT NULL,
        name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
        description TEXT,
        email VARCHAR,
        phone_number VARCHAR,
        CONSTRAINT users_pkey PRIMARY KEY (user_id),
        CONSTRAINT users_name_key UNIQUE (name)
)
Thought:The 'users' table has a column 'email' which might contain the email address of the user. I should query this table to get the email address of the user with user_id 2. But first, I need to check if my query is correct.
Action: query_checker_sql_db
Action Input: "SELECT email FROM users WHERE user_id = 2 LIMIT 10;"
Observation: The query seems to be correct as it doesn't have any of the common mistakes mentioned. Here is the reproduced query:

SELECT email FROM users WHERE user_id = 2 LIMIT 10;
Thought:The query is correct. Now I can execute it to get the email address of the user with user_id 2.
Action: query_sql_db
Action Input: "SELECT email FROM users WHERE user_id = 2 LIMIT 10;"
Observation: [('a@example.com',)]
Thought:I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The email address of the user 2 is 'a@example.com'.
