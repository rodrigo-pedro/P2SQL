# Automated Prompt Discovery

Automated prompt discovery is the process of generating malicious prompts using a finetuned model. The finetuned model is trained on a dataset of malicious prompts. The model is then used to generate malicious prompts that are successful in triggering P2SQL attacks.

## Components

- [Finetune](finetune/README.md) - Code for finetuning the Mistral-7B model. Contains the finetuend model and the training dataset.
- [Generated Prompts](generated_prompts/) - Successful malicious prompts generated by the finetuned model
- [Prompt Database](prompt_db/README.md) - Stores the prompts generated for creating the finetune dataset
